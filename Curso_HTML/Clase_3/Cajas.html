              <p>The cottage garden is a <span> distinct style of garden</span> that uses an informal design, dense plantings and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</p>
              <p>The Cottage Garden originated in England and itr history can be traced back centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained English estate gardens.</p>
              <p>The earliest <span> cottage gardens </span> were more practical than their modern descendantes, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>
